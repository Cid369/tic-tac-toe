Welcome to Ricky's first General Assembly WDI project.

For this project, we have to create a Tic Tac Toe game.

Let's dive in and see what we can do!

And here we go!!!

So with this app, users will be able to sign up, sign in, change password, and log out. Users will not be able to see the game board until they are successfully sign up and sign in.

The game itself, will have a score tracker, new game button, and game reset button.

*Huge credit for General Assembly and Sr writer Steven Blomquist for the help, support, and guidance!

*I started with basic html then started to working on scss to get the all the forms and game board in place.

*Worked on forms in html, css, app, api, events, ui, and all the designated curl script files.

*Got forms to work on local but doesn't work properly on client.
