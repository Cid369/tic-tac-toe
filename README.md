Welcome to Ricky's first General Assembly WDI project.

For this project, we have to create a Tic Tac Toe game.

Let's dive in and see what we can do!

And here we go!!!

So with this app, users will be able to sign up, sign in, change password, and log out. Users will not be able to see the game board until they are successfully sign up and sign in.

The game itself, will have a score tracker, new game button, and game reset button.

* Huge credit for General Assembly and Sr writer Steven Blomquist for the help, support, and guidance!

This app will utilise with HTML, CSS, javascript, and a 3rd party API.

From here on, is my step by step on my progress on this project.

* I started with basic html then started to working on scss to get the all the forms and game board in place.

* Worked on forms in html, css, app, api, events, ui, and all the designated curl script files.

* Got forms to work on local but doesn't work properly on client.

* After carfully checking for errors, I've found out that I was using the incorrect link for all my API. With the correct in place, I am no longer getting any error messages from Chrome inspect.

* Trying to get the game to work but keeps getting an error message for "Cannot read property 'cells' of undefined" and I'm not sure how to fix it. Need to do more research on it.
